# Welcome to ChemCoder!
Contains all the notebooks/code from my journey as a computational chemist on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/@ChemCoder404

I will be happy to organize workshops! You can reach me at keerthanr1@gmail.com

Steps involved in building a reliable predictive model involves more steps than what is depicted in the videos and these notebooks. Over time, I hope to have a video for all the aspects including but not limited to:
1) Data generation/mining/gathering
2) Data preparation (imputation, augmentation etc.)
3) Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
4) Scaling and transformation
5) Data splitting methods (with reasoning and suggestions)
6) Building predictive models (some generative models too)
7) Hyperparameters and tuning
8) Model evaluation
9) Deployment of models
